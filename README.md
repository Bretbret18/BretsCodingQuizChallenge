# CodingQuizChallenge

Coding Quiz Challenge is a quiz to test the user's coding knowledge! This quiz is timed and the timer begins at
75 seconds. Each question the player gets wrong, 5 seconds will be deducted from the timer. The amount of time 
left on the timer at the end of the quiz determines the player's score! At the end of the quiz players will have the chance to enter their initials and post their score. All player scores will be posted on the final page so that the player can see how well they did versus other players' scores. Good luck!
